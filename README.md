# bits-of-C
A handful of tutorials for creating libraries I've found useful in my own projects.
Some of the tutorials assume a reasonably strong knowledge of C (or programming logic in general). I'm not a professional writer, so if things don't look right or stuff gets a bit wordy, toss an EMAIL my way or post and issue.

All files (including this readme) fall under The Unlicense, meaning you can do whatever you want with anything from this repo.

This repo will be ocassionally updated with markdown documents designed to teach people how to create useful libraries for accelerating their development (if you're stubborn and like to do things from scratch like me!). Everything will be done in C.

The final product of each tutorials project will be posted.

If you find discrepancies between tutorials and their accompanied code files, give me a shout and I'll fix it.
